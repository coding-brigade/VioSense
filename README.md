## [Problem Statement](#problem-statement)

The current system of traffic enforcement in India faces multiple inefficiencies. Despite efforts like the "One Nation, One Challan" initiative, there are inconsistencies in challan generation across states, limited automation, and no centralized offender database. Manual monitoring remains error-prone, biased, and incapable of handling modern-day traffic complexities. The absence of real-time offender detection and outdated datasets further hinder effective law enforcement. These issues highlight the urgent need for a smart, scalable, and data-driven traffic surveillance solution.

## [Objectives & Vision](#objectives--vision)
###  Objectives

- Design and deploy a real-time surveillance system integrating ANPR and FRS for offender detection and identity verification.
- Extend violation coverage beyond red-light jumping to include:
  - No helmet or seatbelt
  - Driving without a valid license
  - Use of mobile phones while driving
  - Obscured or fake number plates
- Build a **centralized challan generation system** compliant with the “One Nation, One Challan” initiative for national uniformity.
- Strengthen **offender traceability** by linking vehicle data with biometric identity using deep learning models.
- Enable law enforcement with **smart dashboards**, violation heatmaps, and **real-time alerts** for timely intervention.
- Minimize human bias and reduce manual workload by automating detection, recognition, and reporting processes.
-  Ensure adaptability of the system across regions, lighting conditions, and occlusion scenarios using robust model training.

### 🌍 Vision

To develop and deploy a **machine learning and deep learning–based traffic surveillance infrastructure** that:

- Promotes **road safety and behavioral accountability** through intelligent, automated enforcement.
- Supports **fair, consistent, and non-discriminatory traffic governance** across all states.
- Empowers law enforcement with **data-driven decision-making tools**, central dashboards, and violation analytics.
- Enables **real-time traceability and evidence-backed enforcement** through integrated biometric and vehicle data.
- Scales nationwide with future integration potential into **Aadhaar, RTO, and law enforcement networks** to support long-term digital governance goals.

## [Proposed Solution](#proposed-solution)

### [System Overview](#system-overview)

Our solution presents a **multi-modal intelligent surveillance architecture** that integrates high-performance computer vision models to automate, authenticate, and enhance traffic law enforcement workflows.

At its core, the system leverages:

- **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)** using deep convolutional models (YOLOv8) to localize and extract license plate numbers from real-time CCTV feeds — robust to motion blur, angle distortions, and low-light scenarios.
- **Facial Recognition System (FRS)** powered by pretrained deep learning models to identify and match drivers’ faces, even in the presence of occlusions like helmets, masks, or low-resolution feeds.

The system conducts **contextual violation analysis**, correlates vehicle and identity data, and triggers **automated e-challan generation** using a secure, centralized backend.

#### End-to-End Intelligent Workflow:
1. **Surveillance Input**: Real-time CCTV feeds are captured and preprocessed.
2. **Plate Detection & Parsing**: YOLOv8-based ANPR extracts plate data with character segmentation.
3. **Facial Identity Resolution**: Deep FRS modules detect and match the rider’s face against a database.
4. **Violation Recognition**: System detects conditions like no helmet, mobile usage, or fake number plates.
5. **Rule Violation Trigger**: If violation is confirmed, it auto-generates a **digitally signed challan**.
6. **Offender Registry Update**: Records are logged with visual proof, timestamps, and geolocation.
7. **Role-Based Dashboard Notification**: Alerts are pushed to RTO, Police, and Admin portals with violator profiles.

The system is built to be **modular, API-driven, and deployment-ready** for city-wide and national use cases.

## [ Dataset & Preprocessing](#dataset--preprocessing)

Building a reliable and intelligent surveillance system required a thoughtfully planned data pipeline that captured the diversity, complexity, and unpredictability of real-world Indian traffic conditions. Here’s how we approached it—step by step:

---

### 🛣️ Phase 1: Real-World Data Acquisition

To ensure authenticity, we initiated collaboration with the **East-West Traffic Control Room, Ahmedabad**, under the guidance of the **Honourable Additional Commissioner of Police**. From there:

- We sourced **live CCTV footage** from high-traffic intersections, entry/exit points, and overhead surveillance grids.
- These recordings included a wide range of violations like **helmetless riding**, **mobile phone usage**, **unlicensed driving**, and **plate forgery**.

In parallel, we manually collected supplemental footage from:

- 🏫 College campuses  
- 🏘️ Residential society entry gates  
- 🅿️ Institutional parking zones  

This step helped fill class imbalance for facial identity recognition under occlusion and skewed angles.

### 🛠️ Phase 2: Dataset Construction & Annotation

We structured the dataset into two major modules: ANPR and FRS.

#### 📌 ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition)
- **Raw Images Collected**: 7,412
- **Post-Augmentation Size**: 16,972
- **Classes Annotated**: License plate region
- **Challenges Handled**:
  - Rusted, bent, or faded plates
  - Plate distortion due to angles and motion blur
  - Shadow and lighting inconsistency

#### 📌 FRS (Facial Recognition System)
- **Raw Face Images**: 1,190  
- **Face Boxes Annotated**: 16,234
- **Subjects**: 38 individuals across age groups, genders, and demographics
- **Challenges Handled**:
  - Helmets, masks, sunglasses, scarves
  - Side profiles, head tilt, occlusion
  - Low-resolution video face segmentation

For annotation, we used:
- **LabelImg** for bounding box labeling
- **Custom Python scripts** for automated tag validation and correction

### 🔧 Phase 3: Preprocessing & Augmentation Pipeline

To maximize performance under real-world variability, we applied the following transformation pipeline:

#### 🧹 Preprocessing Techniques

- Resizing inputs for YOLOv8 and FRS model compatibility  
- RGB/BGR conversion for uniformity across sensors  

#### 🧪 Augmentation Strategies
- Brightness & contrast randomization  
- Rotation & affine transformations  
- Horizontal flipping for symmetrical balance  
- Gaussian blur & noise injection to simulate degraded footage  
- Partial occlusion overlays (masks, helmets) to improve FRS generalization
